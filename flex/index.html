                <p>There’s no limit to how many times you can split the editor, but I doubt you will ever want to have more than three views open;</p>
                <p>Having split the editor, we ended up with the same file open in multiple views. Now we would like to focus the explorer panel.</p>

                <p>Often, the body paragraph demonstrates and develops your topic sentence through an ordered, logical progression of ideas. There are a number of useful techniques for expanding on topic sentences and developing your ideas in a paragraph. Illustration in a paragraph supports a general statement by means of examples, details, or relevant quotations (with your comments).</p>
                <p>The definition paragraph does exactly what you would expect: it defines a term, often by drawing distinctions between the term and other related ones. The definition that you provide will often be specific to your subject area. Try to avoid perfunctory dictionary definitions that do not inform your analysis in a meaningful way.</p>
                <p>The analysis or classification paragraph develops a topic by distinguishing its component parts and discussing each of these parts separately.</p>
